# This practice test was written by me, Matt Ehrlich. It should take about 45
# minutes to complete. I didn't use rspec, just the poor man's rspec of having
# tests print out true or false.

# Challenge 1

# Define three functions, my_each, my_map, and my_select. Do not use .each,
# .each_with_index, or a for loop to accomplish this. my_map and my_select
# should use the my_each function.

class Array

  def my_each(&prc)

  end

  def my_map(&prc)

  end

  def my_select(&prc)

  end

end

# Challenge 2

# Define a my_each function for the Hash class. Do not use Hash#each OR
# Array#each to accomplish this. Do not use each_with_index or a for loop either.

class Hash

  def my_each
  end

end
